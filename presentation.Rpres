Data Source
========================================================
Using 1970s census data, this Shiny app gives an interactive comparison of states on several social and economic metrics.

Data come from R's [Datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) package, and can be accessed on any machine with R using the `data` command.
```{r}
data(state)
```  
Further Description of Data can be found at [CRAN](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/state.html)

Available Features
========================================================
For all available metrics, this shiny app will display both a shaded heatmap of the United States and a histogram of the distribution of that matric.  

Using the drop-down menus, you can change the region of interest and colors of the charts.  

Using the radio buttons, you can change which social or economic variable you are comparing across states.

Available Metrics
========================================================
The following variables are available for comparison:  

 - Density (Population/Area)
 - Population
 - Income Per Capita
 - Life Expectancy at Birth
 - Murder Rate (count per 100,000)
